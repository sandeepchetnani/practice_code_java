asynchrozied
difference between array list and linked list

1. arraylist are asynchronized vs linked list is synchronized
2. the internal  structure of arraylist after full is 75%  and linked list not incremental factor    
3.al is dynamic array and ll is doubly linked list
4.  null values are allowed
5. duplicates and heterogenous values are allowed
6. al support indexing and ll doesnot support indexing
7. al needs linear sequential block of memory to be created    while ll  does need linear sequential block
8.insertion orde]r is mainted in al and ll

set:
tree set:
1.only unique element can be stored in set interface
2. implementing class hash ,linked hash tree
3. sorting order of tree set is natural sorting of ascending order
4. heterogenous values are not allowed in tree set(Note:- it will not throw a error except it will throw a class cast exception)
5.duplicates values are not allowed in the tree set
6.the natural order and identification of duplicates are used  compareTo() method of comparable interface
7.the internal data  structure is tree map
8.null values are not allowed(cte will not occur instead we get a null pointer exception
9.there is not incremental factor
10.tree set is the only implemented class of set interface which allow sorting 
11.tree set does not allow indexing
red black tree avl 
12 sort in decesending order with the help constructor



hash set:
1.hash set internally use hash map to store values (insertion order of data is not maintained,random order)
2.since its a set duplicates values are not allowed
3.we can store heterogenous values in hash set
4.indexing is not allowed in hash set
5.null value sis allowed in hash set 	
6.duplicates are not allowed (makes use of equals and hashcode() to eliminate the dupliciatess)


linked hash set

same as hash set
use linked hash map use equal and hashcode
order of insertion is preserved


vector stack


queue tomorrow
