treemap can be sorted but hash map and linked hash map cannot be sorted

hash map;
1.null values as a key as well
2.null value as value 
3.we can have heterogenous value
4.data will be stored randomly in hash map insertion order is not maintained
5.old key value pair will be replaced with new key value
6.


linked hash map

1.internal ds is linked hash table
all same other
insertion order is preserved
1.null values as a key as well
2.null value as value 
3.we can have heterogenous value
4.old key value pair will be replaced with new key value
