map is a interface dictionary
which accept value in key and value both key and value can be of any type

key should always be unique value can be different.
map cannot be iterated to iterate over a map it must be convert into a set

tree map
use red black tree as the internal ds
map cannot be stored(convert in tree set and then sort)
key should be homogenous values can be heterogenous
key should not be the duplicate (old key and value will be replaced by new key and value pair)
keys cannot be null but values can be null
insertion order is not maintained in tree map but entries are sort in natural order ascending based on keys
